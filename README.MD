Here's a readme!

This projects not finished, until its almost done I won't bother to go into detail with setup.

# Getting Started
If you just want to run the project just run via `node .` or `nodejs .` (whichever binary name you're using)

If you'd like to tweak it and work on it then you'll want to know how to do anything fun.
Run `node init-db.js` to populate the database with sample data, edit `init-db.js` to tweak how much sample data is added.
When the database has been setup then you can run `node .` to start the help desk.. Done!

# Database?!
Don't worry, it's just an sqlite database, you don't need a database installed.

Why sqlite?
I'm too lazy to setup MySQL. :D

# How 2 style!?
Easy. The project uses SASS to compile styling.
Just run `gulp sass` to compile styling, if you'd like it to compile changes on the fly then you'll want to run `gulp sass:watch`

# Enjoy
Now go and enjoy this thing..
